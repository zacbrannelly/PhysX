## Introduction

Welcome to the NVIDIA PhysX source code repository.

This repository contains source releases of the PhysX, Flow, and Blast SDKs used in NVIDIA Omniverse.

## O3DE Fork

This fork is mantained by the O3DE community and governed by the **Special Interest Group for Simulation** ([SIG Simulation]((https://github.com/o3de/sig-simulation))). You can ask any questions in the O3DE #sig-simulation [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/o3de).

The main purpose of this fork is the addition of the following platforms to NVIDIA PhysX:

* [Mac](https://github.com/o3de/PhysX/pull/3) (Intel and ARM architectures)
* [iOS](https://github.com/o3de/PhysX/pull/2)
* [Android](https://github.com/o3de/PhysX/pull/1)

Please see instructions specific to each of the platforms in the respective subfolder under [physx/documentation/platformreadme](physx/documentation/platformreadme).

Only Pull Requests related to the new platforms will be taken, for any other contributions please submit them to [the NVIDA fork](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX).
